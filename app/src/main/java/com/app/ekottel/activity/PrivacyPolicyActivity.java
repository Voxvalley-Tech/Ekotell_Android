                "6.11 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and KODATEL regarding the App and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, statements or proposals, and representations, whether written or oral between you and KODATEL regarding the same. No written or oral statement, advertisement or service or product description not expressly contained in this License or in the App will be allowed to contradict, explain, or supplement these terms. You acknowledge that you are not relying on any representations or statements made by KODATEL that are not included in these terms. If any part of this License is found invalid, the rest of this License will remain valid and enforceable. The failure by KODATEL to exercise, or delay in exercising, a legal right or remedy provided by this License or by law shall not constitute a waiver of KODATEL’s right or remedy. If KODATEL waives a breach of these terms by you, the waiver shall not operate as a waiver of a subsequent breach of these terms by you.<br/>" +
                "<br/>" +
                "6.12  Disputes; Arbitration. Both you and KODATEL agree to waive our rights to sue in court and have disputes resolved in court by a judge or jury. Instead, each party agrees to first contact the other party with any dispute and to provide a written description of the problem and any proposed resolutions. If we can’t resolve the dispute, then either party can submit the dispute to arbitration. You and KODATEL agree to resolve disputes by arbitration, including any dispute as to the interpretation or application of this Section. Arbitration is a means of having an independent third party resolve a dispute. The rules of arbitration are different from the rules of a court. In an arbitration there is no judge or jury, but the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief and must honor the same limitations stated in this License as a court would. The term dispute shall mean any claim or controversy of any nature arising out of or in any way related to this License, the App and/or the Services, including but not limited to federal or state contract, tort, statutory, regulatory, common law and equitable claims. Either you or KODATEL can request at any time that a dispute be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as such rules are modified by this User Agreement. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling +1-587-778-9095. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based solely on written submissions, or in person in Edmonton Canada or any other mutually agreed location. KODATEL shall pay all of the AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees up to $25,000. Thereafter, KODATEL and you will divide equally all such fees and expenses of the arbitration. KODATEL shall not pay your travel expenses or your costs in preparing and presenting your case, including your legal fees. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. You agree to waive your right to consolidate your dispute with the disputes or claims of other consumers or customers. You agree to waive your right to bring a dispute as a class action or as a private attorney general, and you agree to waive your right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. You can opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending a letter via overnight mail to KodaTel Communications Corp Legal Department, indicating your desire to opt out of this Section. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.<br/>" +
                "<br/>" +
                "6.13 Changes to Terms. KODATEL may in our sole discretion update, revise or change this License or the information in the App from time to time with or without prior notice. When material changes are made we will post them in the App and update this License. The App will be updated on or before the effective date of the change, unless an immediate change is necessary for a legitimate business reason, or to maintain the security of the system or unless a law, rule or regulation requires that it be updated an earlier time. Please review this License and the applicable Service Terms referenced in Section 2.3. By continuing to use the App or any Service through the App after publication of a change, you agree to the change. If you do not agree to the change you may terminate your relationship with KodaTel Communications Corp as provided in Section 5.3.<br/>" +

However, the meanings of terms, conditions and representations herein are subject to definitions and interpretations in the English language. If there is any inconsistency between a non-English version and the English version, then the English version shall govern your relationship with KodaTel Communications Corp.
